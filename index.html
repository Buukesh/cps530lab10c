        <h2>Setting up this Website</h2>
        <p>
            I set up this Vue.js website, following these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Create an HTML file and include the necessary structure.</li>
                <li>Create a CSS file for styling and link it in the HTML file.</li>
                <li>Include the Vue.js library in the HTML file using a
                    <a href="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js" target="_blank">CDN</a>
                invocation.</li>
                <li>Create a JavaScript file for the Vue.js application logic.</li>
                <li>Write my Vue.js code inside the setup function.</li>
                <li>Mount the Vue app to the specified element (in my case, #app).</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Difficulties with Vue.js</h2>
        <p>
            One of the difficulties I faced was how to correctly set up a Vue.js project with the proper file
            structure, especially when it came to integrating the app.js script which housed the Vue app. 
            Intially, I was unsure what the logic would be more suited for
            the html file or the app.js file. However, reading the 
                <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>
            proved to be a valuable resource in clarifying this confusion. The html file
            is more concerned with structural layout and static content. On the other hand,
            the app.js logic deals with dynamic content and updates to the DOM. I was able to gather this
            from the high-level introduction in the docs.
